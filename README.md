# DREAMweaver

Project Title: 
DREAMweaver

Project Description: 
This is an app designed to encourage users to pursue their dream in a community format. It was inspired by Barbara Sher's TED talk titled "Isolation is the dream-killer, not your attitude," that put forth the idea of success teams, or groups of people who work together to make each other's dream come true. In this app, a user gets to see, comment on and encourage other users' goals. There are times when everyone gets tired and in those times, when a specific user needs an extra reminder/push, the community members (other users) step in, posting comments of encouragement or personal stories of their journey designed to give strength to the user. This app is for users who value the setting and accomplishment of dreams, be it their own or a complete stranger's. 

Project Motivation:
DREAMweaver was built to bring together people through dreams and create a supportive atmosphere in which no users feels alone in their journey. 

Project Instructions:
First, the user is prompted to sign in or create an account. Before they do so, they have the option to read about the project. Second, after signing in or creating a new account,the user is taken to a page where they can see others' dreams called the community page. At this point, the user can decide to view a community member's dream or go to own dream/profile page. If user decides to see another member's dream, the user has the option to leave a comment. In the user's own profile page, the use can edit their profile/dream, add comment to their own dream or create a brand new one. After making those changes, the user is taken back to the profile page where they can exit back to the community page and finally logout.
